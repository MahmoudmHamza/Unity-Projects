# Death Path

>**Brief**

**Death Path** is a 2D game of "Tower Defense" genre developed using Unity3D engine in which you have different types of towers that should be placed to stop periodically spawning enemies from reaching your castle. The number of enemies increments each round, but killing them unlocks more powerful tower types.

>**Note**

This game is one of my first projects that introduced me to Game Development and Unity engine, So it's expected to find low quality code. Maybe one day in the future I can re-visit this project to improve it.
