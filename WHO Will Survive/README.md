# WHO will survive?

>**Brief**

**WHO Will Survive?** is a 2D game inspired by the horrible COVID-19 pandemic in which scientists managed to find a vaccine that protects people from being infected by this virus, but it needs time to produce enough amount of it. Sadly, the town's main hospital has patients that diagnosed with COVID-19. Although the doctors and nurses were taking all precautions, some viruses managed to escape from the hospital infecting people all over the city. You should stop the corona-virus from spreading in your hometown to save as much time as you can for the vaccine to be produced.
