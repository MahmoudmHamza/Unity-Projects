# Legend Of Arcka

>**Brief**

**Legend of Arcka** is a game developed using Unity3D engine in which you control a character called "Arcka" who lives in a small peaceful village. One day, the goblins showed up from no where and attacked the village. Your main objective is to rescue your people from the outsider goblins. You can also find some power ups that might help you defeating them and save the day.

>**Note**

This game is one of my first projects that introduced me to Game Development and Unity engine, So it's expected to find low quality code. Maybe one day in the future I can re-visit this project to improve it.
