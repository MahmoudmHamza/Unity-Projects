# THOR: The star of Nidavellir

>**Overview**

**THOR: The star of Nidavellir** is a 2D game inspired by Marvel's **Avengers: End Game** movie in which Thor’s Storm Breaker is crafted.
After the destruction of his hammer Mjolnir, Thor have to make a new weapon to prevent Thanos from killing half of all creatures. This type of weapons can be crafted only in a mythical place called Nidavellir.
Unfortunately, there’s not enough energy for the weapon to be made because Nidavellir star is frozen. Your main objective is to melt the star by shooting plasma bolts using your spaceship to provide enough energy for Eitri to craft Storm Breaker for Thor.
